# Simple Weather App: An R Shiny Application 

## R Packages Used:

* shiny
* leaflet
* maps
* jsonlite
* httr
* future  

## Instructions

This simple shiny app uses the [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/) web API to get the current weather at a location that is clicked on the displayed map. In order for this app to work on your local machine, you need to [sign up](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) for an account in order to get an appid (API key that allows you to get the free weather report from [openweathermap.org](https://openweathermap.org/).

Once you have created an account you will recieve an appid key. Save this key on the first line in a file called: `www/appid.txt`.
If you have done this and have installed all of the needed packages, then you should be able to successfully run this app on your local machine.
